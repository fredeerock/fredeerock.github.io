Musical practice in the early 21st century is wildly expanding.  Technology and media meld in unexpected ways with acoustic instruments and human voices.  Data and society form new sources for musical expression.  The works of Sonic Artist Jesse Allison traverse from sound environments to harmonica, laptop orchestra to audience mobile phones, interactive installations to loudspeaker orchestra. This performance in the Digital Media Center Theatre’s 92-speaker immersive sound environment is one that pushes the experience of sound and music to its limits.

Special guests for this concert include:

Joe Skillen – Tuba  
Vincent Cellucci – Poetry  
Frederick Ostrenko – Digital Art  
Sandra Parks – Choreography  
Robert Kooima – Visualization  
Louisiana Mobile App Orchestra
